# Nanny-Calulator
Project creating a paycheck calculator specifically for U.S. private nannies

I've been a nanny for over 6 years. The U.S. government provides very few public resources and very little aid to parents, and therefore private childcare can be a lucrative career if you have the qualifications and resources to play your cards right. However, due to the nature of the career -- often worked by young women, often the only employee of a private family, usually a new position every few years, no HR department, etc. -- it can be difficult for nannies to enforce industry standards in hiring processes and throughout their positions. Many people, especially those unfamiliar with the industry, are unaware that these standards even exist. Nannies are adults (even if they are young students) with rent, bills, families, and lives, and deserve the same job standards and benefits that any other industry might expect and enjoy. These standards usually include:

- Formal contracts outlining clear expectations, duties, boundaries, protections, etc.
- Paid sick leave
- PTO to be used at their own discretion
- Federal holidays off 
- W2 taxed income 
- Guaranteed hours 
- Overtime pay 
- Mileage reimbursement 
- Healthcare stipend
- Livable wage 

Another standard, one more difficult to outline clearly, is the expectation that both the employer and employee will behave and interact professionally throughout their working relationship. It can be difficult to achieve this for several reasons. Firstly, it is an intimate role quite unlike any other I’ve ever held. Nannies work long hours in someone else’s home caring for the most loved and cherished aspects of their lives. In many of my nannying positions I’ve spent three times as many waking hours with a child than the parent does. As a professional caretaker, you are essentially hired to serve as an additional parent for a child, and this can lead to incredibly close bonds with both the children and also their other caretakers as you share the collective role in raising them. However, this intimacy can lead to some blurred boundaries, and it is quite easy for nannies to suddenly find themselves doing care and home tasks way outside their personal boundaries or the boundaries of their original job agreements. Additionally, due to the nature of the position (see first paragraph) and the low level of respect generally given to professional caregivers in this country, it is quite common for parent-employers to purposefully attempt to take advantage of their nannies, and it can be difficult for nannies to vouch for themselves with no formal avenue of recourse. 

One situation I’ve encountered more than once in my career is a parent-employer attempting to cut my paycheck. I’m not sure why they would attempt this; I’m clearly capable of keeping track of my hours and expenses and calculating the correct amount on my own. The sad truth is that this situation most definitely happens to many other nannies as well, many of whom may not be as assertive as I have grown to be in this career.

I built this paycheck calculator primarily for this purpose. It is meant to be used by a nanny in order to double check the amount received from their employer. It is not perfect or finished, and there are several severe limitations due to the limitations of my own knowledge and schedule at the time.

My secondary purpose was to give nannies a way to determine whether or not they would be earning a living wage after taxes.
